# Types of Data Science Questions

## Descriptive 

**Goal:** To describe or summarize a set of data

* Early analysis when receiving new data 
* Generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements
* **Not** for generalizing the results of the analysis to a larger population


## Exploratory 

**Goal:** To examine the data and find relationships that weren't previously known

* Explore how different variables might be related
* Useful for discovering new connections
* Help to formulate hypotheses and drive the design of future studies and data collection

## Inferential 

**Goal:** Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about the population at large

* Provide your estimate of the variable for the population and provide your uncertainty about your estimate 
* Ability to accurately infer information about the larger population depends heavily on sampling scheme

## Predictive

**Goal:** Use current and historical data to make predictions about future data

* Accuracy in predictions is dependent on measuring the right variables 
* Many ways to build up prediction models with some being better or worse for specific cases

## Causal 

**Goal:** See what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable

* Gold standard in data analysis
* Often applied  to the results on randomized studies that were designed to identify causation
* Usually analyzed in aggregate and observed relationships are usually average effects

## Mechanistic 

**Goal:** Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables 

* Applied to simple situations or those that are nicely modeled by deterministic equations 
* Commonly applied to physical or engineering sciences
* Often, the only noise in the data is measurement error

## Control Structures - if/else



if(condition) {

      <do something>

} else("condition2") {

      <do something else>
}



--



if(condition) {

      <do something>
      
{ else if(condition2) {

      <do something different>
      
} else {

      <do something else>
}


## Control Structures - for loop


for(i in vect){
      
      <function>[i]
}


## Control Structures - while



while(finite condition){

      <do something>
}




## Control Structures - repeat, next, break, return


`repeat` is a construct that basically initiates an infinite loop. 
The only way to exit a `repeat` loop is to call `break`

`next` is basically used in any time of looping construct when you want to skip an iteration.

`return` signals that a function should exit and and return a given value




# Functions 

Basic format:


f <- function(x, y = <default value>){
  
  x+y
  
}


User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:

      %[whatever]% 
      
where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.


# Dates and Time


Dates are represented by the `Date` class and times are represented by the `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt` classes.
Internally, dates are stored as the number of days since 1970-01-01 and times are stored as either the number 
of seconds since 1970-01-01 (for `POSIXct`) or a list of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. (for `POSIXlt`).


`strptime()` converts character vectors to `POSIXlt`.


If you want more control over the units when finding the above difference in times, you can use `difftime()`, 
which allows you to specify a 'units' parameter.




# Loop functions

`lapply`: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element

`sapply`: Same as `lapply` but try to simplify the result

`apply`: Apply the function over the margins of an array

`tapply`: Apply a function over the subsets of a vector

`mapply`: Multivariate function of `lapply`
